	<h3>Common Knowledge</h3>
	<p>One of the more mysterious members of the sept, outside of her pack and her positional duties for the sept, little is known about Anna Romani beyond the stories of her deeds.  A known card shark and able to bluff the best, Anna is known to be willing to whatever it takes to accomplish her goals.  Beyond that, she tends to keep to herself and her pack, only steping in when needed, usually in legal matters.  That being said, if it's shady as hell and you need it done, she's your garou.</p>
