	<h3>Common Knowledge</h3>
	<p>A member of the sept almost from birth, Hope Alighieri's parentage is both a matter of pride and prejudace.  Her mother was an Uktena Theurge and the original rites master of the Sept of the Far Dawn.  Her father is a Pumonca who, while resident at the Sept of the Far Dawn, has not always been obvious as to where his loyalties lie.  Because of this, she often acts as an intermediary between the sept and her father.  Her loyalties to the sept have not been questioned, though.  She has been warder for over five years and her pack guards it zealously.</p>
