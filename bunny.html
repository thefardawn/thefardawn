	<h3>Common Knowledge</h3>
	<p>A recent addition to the sept, Bunny joined Barrage Inc. during a recent mission.  While she's an expert marksman, Bunny likes about anything that deals a lot of damage to the Wyrm such as guns, explosives, and trebuches (the superior seige weapon.  Her metis deformity is her ears, which is where she got her nickname: a pair of tall, normally blonde rabbit ears that she dyes along with the rest of her hair.  She's obsessed with anime and manga and will go to great lengths to act the heroine if given the chance.</p>
